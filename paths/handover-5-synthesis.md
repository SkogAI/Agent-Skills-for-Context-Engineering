# Handover: Synthesis — Personal Reference

## Context

Two sessions completed a critical deep dive of all 13 skills in the Agent Skills for Context Engineering collection (`/home/skogix/dev/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/`). Journal entries with full analysis:
- `journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-fundamentals-deep-dive.md` (part 1, 6 skills)
- `journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-deep-dive-part2.md` (part 2, 7 skills)

## Task

Compress the 13-skill, 2-session analysis into a personal reference document. Not the collection's words — a synthesis in the user's own operating philosophy.

### What to Extract

From the part 1 deep dive (6 skills):
- The subtractive inversion: `full_context_output - starved_context_output = delta`, only the delta is IP
- 25k effective limit vs. theoretical thresholds
- Proximity > position: +/-8k from focus is practical attention range
- Telephone game as feature: intentional lossy compression between layers maintains strategic altitude
- Partitioning as default, not nuclear option
- Filesystem memory beats specialized tools (Letta file agents > Mem0)
- Prompt-native endpoint: zero explicit tools, plain text intents

From the part 2 deep dive (7 skills):
- Tokens-per-task not tokens-per-request
- Three-phase workflow is partitioning, not compression
- L1/L2 cache model: context window = hot cache, filesystem = backing store
- 95% finding: token usage explains 80% of variance in exploration; decision quality matters more for execution
- Architectural reduction: Vercel 17→2 tools, 80%→100% success
- "Primary reason for multi-agent is context isolation" — a strong claim the user actively disagrees with for role anthropomorphization
- Dynamic context discovery as unifying principle

### Format

The output should be a single dense reference document. No fluff, no explanations of basics. Written for someone who has already internalized the material and needs a lookup table, not a tutorial.

Structure suggestion:
1. Principles (the non-negotiable operating rules)
2. Patterns (the reusable architectural moves)
3. Numbers (the empirical data points worth remembering)
4. Disagreements (where the collection's claims conflict with practice)
5. Gaps (what the collection doesn't cover that matters)

### Important Note

The user explicitly said they want the fresh outside perspective preserved — do NOT rewrite the collection's claims to match the user's philosophy. Present the collection's view faithfully, note where it aligns and conflicts, and let the reader hold both.

## Output

Write to `journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-synthesis.md`.
