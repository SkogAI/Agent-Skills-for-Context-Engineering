I'd like your help to continue guiding the user through the context engineering collection at @/home/skogix/dev/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/. We've critically analyzed all 13 skills across two sessions — notes in @/home/skogix/claude/journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-fundamentals-deep-dive.md and @/home/skogix/claude/journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-deep-dive-part2.md.

Now the user wants to get hands-on with the example projects in examples/. Run the code, see what actually works, and find out if the examples live up to the skills they claim to implement. The user has deep practical experience with context engineering so engage critically, not as a tour guide.

Most interest during the deep dive was in filesystem-context patterns, architectural reduction, and the evaluation pipeline.
