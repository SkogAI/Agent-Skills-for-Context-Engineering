# Handover: Researcher Methodology Analysis

## Context

Two sessions completed a critical deep dive of all 13 skills in the Agent Skills for Context Engineering collection (`/home/skogix/dev/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/`). Journal entries with full analysis:
- `journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-fundamentals-deep-dive.md` (part 1, 6 skills)
- `journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-deep-dive-part2.md` (part 2, 7 skills)

## Task

Analyze the curation methodology in `researcher/` — this is the meta-skill that determines what becomes a skill in the collection. Evaluate whether the methodology is sound, whether it's actually followed, and what it reveals about the collection's quality control.

## The Files

In `/home/skogix/dev/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/researcher/`:

| File | Lines | What it covers |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `llm-as-a-judge.md` | 362 | Principal Research Curator methodology |
| `example_output.md` | 75 | Sample output from the curation pipeline |

## Key Things to Examine

### The 4 Gatekeeper Gates
The methodology has 4 mandatory triage gates that content must pass before becoming a skill:
1. Mechanism Specificity
2. Implementable Artifacts
3. Beyond Basics
4. Source Verifiability

Questions: Are these gates actually enforced? Can you find skills in the collection that would fail one or more gates?

### The Dimensional Scoring
4-dimension rubric using 3-point scale. Questions: What are the dimensions? How do they weight? Is the scoring rubric itself well-designed by the advanced-evaluation skill's own standards?

### Bias Avoidance
Claims to guard against length-bias, reputation-bias, and infrastructure-focused content. Questions: Does the collection show evidence of these biases anyway?

### Meta-Evaluation
Apply the collection's own evaluation skills (evaluation + advanced-evaluation) to the curation methodology. Does the methodology pass its own standards?

## Output

Write findings to `journal/2026-02-27/researcher-methodology-analysis.md`.
