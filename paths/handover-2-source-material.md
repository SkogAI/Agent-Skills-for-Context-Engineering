# Handover: Source Material Provenance

## Context

Two sessions completed a critical deep dive of all 13 skills in the Agent Skills for Context Engineering collection (`/home/skogix/dev/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/`). Journal entries with full analysis:
- `journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-fundamentals-deep-dive.md` (part 1, 6 skills)
- `journal/2026-02-27/context-engineering-deep-dive-part2.md` (part 2, 7 skills)

## Task

Read the source material in `docs/` that informed the skills. Compare what the sources actually say vs. what the skills synthesized from them. Identify where the skills correctly distilled, where they drifted, and where valuable source material was left on the table.

## The Source Files

All in `/home/skogix/dev/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering/docs/`:

| File | Lines | What it covers |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `agentskills.md` | 1,263 | Anthropic's official Agent Skills format specification |
| `blogs.md` | 1,230 | Curated technical blog posts on context engineering |
| `compression.md` | 297 | Context compression techniques research |
| `claude_research.md` | 84 | Claude-specific research findings |
| `vercel_tool.md` | 139 | Vercel AI SDK tool design patterns |
| `gemini_research.md` | 21 | Gemini API research |
| `hncapsule.md` | 92 | HN discussions on context engineering |
| `netflix_context.md` | 9 | Netflix context engineering case study |

## Approach

For each source file:
1. Read it fully
2. Map claims in the source to claims in the skills that cite it
3. Note where the skill faithfully synthesized the source
4. Note where the skill drifted or added interpretation not in the source
5. Note valuable material in the source that didn't make it into any skill

Pay special attention to:
- `agentskills.md` — this is the format spec. Does the collection actually follow it?
- `blogs.md` — at 1,230 lines this is the largest source. Which blogs influenced which skills?
- `compression.md` — does the context-compression skill faithfully represent the Factory Research findings?
- `vercel_tool.md` — does the tool-design skill and the architectural reduction claim in project-development match what Vercel actually published?

## Output

Write findings to `journal/2026-02-27/source-material-provenance.md`.
